# Predicting-U.S.-Flight-Delay
As being a frequent passenger, the importance of the plane on time is beyond discussion. Knowing the possible flight delay or even increase the punctuality rate of the flight could really improve the trip experience. ‘Is it possible to predict the flight delay or are there certain ways to improve it’ is frequently asked by both domestic and international passengers. This paper aims to analyse the flight records of the USA in 2015 to find out if there are some correlations between the flight delays and other attributes from those records. This research will indicate which kind of flight under what circumstances are more likely to suffer from delay. Out team will mainly conduct two tasks, the first task is to distinguish whether the flight will delay by using proper classification models. And then to predict the possible time delay with regression models.
